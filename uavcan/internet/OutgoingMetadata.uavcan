# This union specifies the used protocol and defines its specific metadata for outgoing packets.
# In the future, more protocols may be added here in a backward-compatible manner.
#
# The maximum size of each nested field MUST NOT exceed 258 bytes; otherwise, the backward
# compatibility will be lost. The number 258 is dictated by the UDP metadata definition;
# please refer to the data type udp.Outgoing for details.
